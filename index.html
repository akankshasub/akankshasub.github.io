 	Hello!
</h1>
<p>
My name is Akanksha. I graduated from University of Bristol in 2021 with a degree in Medicine. I am currently working as a junior doctor in the NHS. 
<br>	
I am currently working on a systematic review on ethnic minority group inclusion as a first author.  
	<br>
	<p>
	Outside of medicine, I spend time supporting medical school applicants in getting into medical school and design infographics on canva.
		I love to cook and am on a journey to living a more sustainable lifestyle. </p>
